# Step 3: Crop Volume

This step is where the stitched lightsheet scans are cropped in 3D to isolate a particular volume of interest. A max projection of the stroke mask obtained from the previous step is overlayed onto a max projection of the original scan. This highlights the stroke area and allows the researcher to select their ROI with this information in mind.
