# Background
This repository contains all the material required to replicate and understand the lightsheet analysis pipeline used for the paper "Glycine Transporter-1 Antagonism Induced Neuroprotection in Vivo".

# Usage
The root directory of this repository contains 7 sub folders labeled Step[0-6]. Each subfolder contains a README detailing specifics about it's particular step in the pipeline. Each subfolder contains:

* All source code used for the step.
* Names and version numbers of all 3rd party tools used for the step.
* Background information about the purpose of the step.
* Detailed instructions for running the step, including what is required as input and what should be generated as output.
* Common troubleshooting questions and answers.
* Contact information pointing at whoever designed that step.
