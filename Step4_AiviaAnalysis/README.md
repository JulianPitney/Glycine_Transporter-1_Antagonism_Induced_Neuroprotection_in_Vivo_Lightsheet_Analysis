# Step 4: Aivia Analysis

This step is where the preprocessed lightsheet scans are fed into Aivia 9.0. Aivia performs a number of tasks including;

* 3D Reconstruction of the vascular network (mesh output)
* Count number of branch points in vascular network
* Estimate total length of vascular network
* Estimate vessel diameter for all vessels

These metrics are taken to be signals of overall vascular health.
